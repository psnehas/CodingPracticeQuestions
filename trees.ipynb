    "- there is no limitation on the degree of a node\n",

    "- the subtree of a general tree is unordered because the nodes of the generatl tree cannot be ordered accprding to a specific criteria.\n",
    "- each node has in-degree(number of parent nodes) one and a maximum out-degree(number of child nodes) n.\n",

    "- can be empty\n",
    "- there is a limitation on the degree of a node because the nodes in a binary tree can't have more than 2 child nodes.\n",

    "A binary tree is balanced if the height of the tree is O(logn) where n is the number of nodes. e.g., the AVL tree maintains O(logn) height by making sure that the difference between the heights of the left and right subtres is almost 1. Red-Black trees maintian O(logn) height by making sure that the number of black nodes on every root to leaf paths is the same and there are no adjacent red nodes. \n",
